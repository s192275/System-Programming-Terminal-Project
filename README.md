# System-Programming-Terminal-Project
This is an application terminal for System Programming With C Lecture
If you run the any of codes(singleshell.c or multishell.c) you must compile first (gcc -o singleshell singleshell.c for example). After that you can run (just type ./singleshell)
It looks like a terminal (username part is red like kali) and it runs like a terminal you can use basic terminal commands(ls, cd.. pwd, su, whoami etc.) When you type exit it will terminate.
If you run the multishell.c you must compile first just like singleshell example. After that you can run like ./multishell 4 for example. It creates 4 singleshell terminal. You can change the number (whatever you want)
When it's started and ended and after every command it creates a log file and it keeps the date when it started and ended. Also it keeps your command with single hash(we tried to create a single hash it appends first 5 bytes
to command)
